         <h2>CERTIFICATES</h2>
         <P>It is becoming more common for higher education institutions to award certificates to continuing education students. These certificates vary, usually involve rigorous courses, and can be affiliated with many associations. </P><br><p>
            University certificates are also becoming more common ways for people to engage in areas of interest while working full-time. They can be completed with a minimum grade in a series of university courses, and are sometimes taken as a way to further one's professional career (either by requirement or choice). They are gaining credence and ground in both the academic world and the working world.
         </p><br><p>It also may be awarded as a necessary certification to validate that a student is considered competent in a certain specific networking skill area in information technology. Thus a computer engineer or computer science graduation most likely will have to obtain additional certificates on and pertaining to the specific technologies or equipment used by the hiring corporation; if not, such employer may suffer unwanted penalties like forgoing (voiding the contract) the protections of a certain level of customer service or warranties</p><br><p>Enhance your marketability with one of our certificates. The College of General Studies offers 14 different undergraduate certificates available as standalone programs or as an opportunity to be pursued in conjunction with another undergraduate degree. You also have the option of applying the credits you earn toward a future degree. So you can start in your chosen discipline while carefully considering whether it represents your missing puzzle piece...or perhaps a stepping stone to the next phase of your education.

            Our certificates cover various disciplines and professional fields, so you are sure to find the right fit. You educational experience will also be enhanced by our interdisciplinary programs which represent collaborative offerings between different schools and departments with London University</p>
